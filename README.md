# google-classroom-document-download-tool
Because sometimes you just want all the files — without right-click → download → repeat 1000 times. This tool sneaks into Google Classroom (with your cookies ), grabs every .ipynb, .pdf, .png, etc., and saves them nicely with the right names.  No API, no pain. Just download and chill.
