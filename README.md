# google-classroom-document-download-tool

Because sometimes you just want all the files — without right-click → download → repeat 1000 times.  
This tool sneaks into Google Classroom (with your cookies), grabs every `.ipynb`, `.pdf`, `.png`, etc., and saves them with the correct names.  

No API, no pain. Just download and chill.
